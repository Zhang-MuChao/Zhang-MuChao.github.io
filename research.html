    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This paper investigates the role played by informational frictions in college and the workplace. We estimate a dynamic structural model of schooling and work decisions, where individuals have imperfect information about their schooling ability and labor market productivity. We take into account the heterogeneity in schooling investments by distinguishing between two- and four-year colleges, graduate school, as well as science and non-science majors for four-year colleges. Individuals may also choose whether to work full-time, part-time, or not at all. A key feature of our approach is to account for correlated learning through college grades and wages, whereby individuals may leave or re-enter college as a result of the arrival of new information on their ability and productivity. Our findings indicate that the elimination of informational frictions would increase the college graduation rate by 9 percentage points, and would increase the college wage premium by 32.7 percentage points through increased sorting on ability. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors for pipeline corrosion monitoring 
			have been considered an attractive area due to the advantages of battery-free and maintenance-free. Due to the skin effect of high-frequency electromagnetic waves, 
			existing RFID sensors can only detect the surface corrosion of pipelines. To realize internal corrosion monitoring, a magnetic permeability perturbation-based RFID 
			sensing method was developed in this paper. Under direct-current (DC) magnetization, internal corrosion causes magnetic field distortions and incurs magnetic permeability 
			perturbations in the skin layer of surface. These perturbations can be detected by the RFID sensor. Considering the resonance frequency shift (RFS) as a feature, a patch 
			antenna sensitive to magnetic permeability was designed. Moreover, steel plates with artificial internal defects were simulated and tested to validate the feasibility of 
			the proposed method. It was observed that the surface magnetic permeability perturbations caused by internal corrosions of different depths incur different RFS values. 
			Finally, pipelines with artificial and natural internal corrosions were tested to validate the feasibility of the proposed method. The RFS caused by the natural corrosion
			was 4.26 MHz, and the RFS caused by the sound area was 1.63 MHz. The proposed magnetic permeability perturbation-based RFID method provides a promising method for pipeline
			internal corrosion monitoring with the application of RFID sensing technology. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Structural health monitoring (SHM) plays a critical role in ensuring the safety of large-scale structures during their operational lifespan, such as pipelines, railways and buildings. In the last few years, radio frequency identification (RFID) combined with sensors has attracted increasing interest in SHM for the advantages of being low cost, passive and maintenance-free. Numerous scientific papers have demonstrated the great potential of RFID sensing technology in SHM, e.g., RFID vibration and crack sensing systems. Although considerable progress has been made in RFID-based SHM, there are still numerous scientific challenges to be addressed, for example, multi-parameters detection and the low sampling rate of RFID sensing systems. This paper aims to promote the application of SHM based on RFID from laboratory testing or modelling to large-scale realistic structures. First, based on the analysis of the fundamentals of the RFID sensing system, various topologies that transform RFID into passive wireless sensors are analyzed with their working mechanism and novel applications in SHM. Then, the technical challenges and solutions are summarized based on the in-depth analysis. Lastly, future directions about printable flexible sensor tags and structural health prognostics are suggested. The detailed discussion will be instructive to promote the application of RFID in SHM.

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Radio frequency identification (RFID) antenna sensors have become one of the most interesting areas of passive strain sensing owing to the advantages of battery-less and wireless interrogation. However, existing RFID methods could mainly detect strain magnitude with its direction along the length or width of the radiant element. To meet the practical purpose of strain detection, a magnitude and direction detection method based on an RFID sensor array is proposed. First, a single strain sensor, i.e., a short stub feed patch antenna, is designed. Specifically, taking resonant frequency shift (RFS) as the feature of strain amplitude, the sensor has different sensitivities in the electrical length direction and width direction. Then, based on this characteristic, a sensor array consisting of four sensors with a mutual angle of 45° is proposed to achieve the quantitative detection of strain magnitude and direction. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is validated by simulations and experiments. Experimental results show that the sensitivities of the single strain sensor in the longitude direction and transverse direction are −873.91 and 57.28 Hz/με , respectively. The strain magnitude detection accuracy of the proposed sensor array is within 10% except for individual abnormal values, and the direction detection error of the sensor array is within 3°.																						</p></div>

    Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Does temperature affect real economic activity? Using the annual Current Population Survey between 1963 and 2015, we show that there is no association between temperature and earnings, hours, or output after controlling for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-varying demographic factors. These results are robust to five separate sources of micro-data, different sampling horizons, functional forms, spatial measures of temperature, and subsets of the data. This paper studies the relationship between temperature and productivity across space and time. Motivated by these null results, we develop a spatial equilibrium model where temperature can affect not only firm productivity, but also individual locational choice. After calibrating the model, we use it to disentangle the role of reallocation versus actual productivity losses in the U.S. economy between 1980 and 2015. Nearly all of the variation is driven by reallocation. We subsequently use the model to evaluate a counterfactual climate scenario and recover a new spatial equilibrium for the U.S. economy by 2050. </p></div><br>
